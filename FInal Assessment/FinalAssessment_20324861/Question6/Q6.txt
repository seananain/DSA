a) 
    1) No wrap
    My assignment code will not need to be extended to implement this keyboard. Similar keyboard have been implemented into the assignment code already.

    2) No wrap
    In order to extend my assignment code to implement this keyboard, the nodes to be read will be both the traditional alphabet keys. Assuming that the 
    only form of 'traditional' keyboard will be the alphabet shown at the top of the page, all those keys will then be respectively adjacent to one another. 
    All names of titles or actors/actresses will be stores separately from the main keyboard graph as an array. 
    Once some letters have been entered, such as the string "Jane", program will search for all material with tites starting with those characters and be
    displayed as a list beneath the keyboard. This program can then traverse down this list and select the needed title, adding these traversed titles to 
    it's travel path.

b)

c)
