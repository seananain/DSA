a) 
    1) No wrap
    My assignment code will not need to be extended to implement this keyboard. Similar keyboard have been implemented into the assignment code already. 

    2) No wrap
    My assignment code will not need to be extended to implement this keyboard. This keyboard can be easily reproduced using the keyboard files used for
    my assignment, which consists of a node and all its adjacent nodes. For this keyboard, this list would look like a list of all the nodes and the nodes
    on the left and right of that respective node.

b)
    For keyboard 1 from 6a, its performance will be very similar to an existing keyboard used for my assignment. This keyboard is very similar to the keyboard
    file "netflix.al" which is found within my assignment folder. The performance of this keyboard is explored within the assignment. When provided a string, 
    "hello marker", the keyboard can type out this string with 33 moves using breadth first search and in 66 moves using depth first search.
    For keyboard 2, it can be expected to have a worse performance in comparison to keyboard 1 due to the increased complexity of the logic for the keyboard.
    Due to the keyboard having to continually generate a list of titles with the same starting characters as what has been inputted within the keyboard, it can
    be expected the performance to worsen.

c) 
    This strategy to optimise data entry can be supported by my approach to the assignment. This keyboard shown can be implemented by loading a generic alpanumeric
    keyboard which is shown in the example for the questions and remove specific nodes which correlate to the 'empty' keys on the keyboard used in this strategy. The
    respective edges will also be replaced. An alternate approach would be loading a keyboard that already has those specific keys removed and edges replaced.
